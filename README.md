## Description

* This is the last project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. In this project, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. And I also converted this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.


## Run the Application

To run the project:
* download or clone the repository in your computer:
$ git clone https://github.com/fangyao-esri/Restaurant-Reviews-App

* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
